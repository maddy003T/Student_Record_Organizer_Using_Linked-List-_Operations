Student Record Management System using Linked Lists

Overview This project is a menu-driven Student Record Management System
developed in the C programming language using linked lists. It provides
an efficient way to store, update, and manage student information
dynamically. The system demonstrates practical use of data structures,
dynamic memory allocation, and file handling, making it an excellent
academic or portfolio project.

Features 1. Add New Record Allows the user to create a new student entry
and insert it into the linked list.

2.  Delete a Record Removes a student record from the list based on a
    given identifier (e.g., roll number).

3.  Show All Records Displays the complete list of stored student data
    in a readable format.

4.  Modify Existing Record Enables editing of student details without
    deleting the entry.

5.  Save Records Stores all current records in a text file to preserve
    data for future use.

6.  Sort Records Sorts the student list, typically by roll number, name,
    or marks (depending on implementation).

7.  Reverse List Reverses the entire linked list order and displays it.

8.  Delete All Records Clears all student data from memory in a single
    action.

9.  Exit Safely terminates the program.

Technologies Used - C Programming Language - Linked List Data
Structure - Dynamic Memory Allocation (malloc, free) - File Handling
(fopen, fprintf, fread)

How It Works The system stores each student as a node in a linked list.
Each node contains the student’s details and a pointer to the next node.
Operations like insert, delete, modify, and sort are implemented using
linked list fundamentals, ensuring efficient performance and flexible
memory usage.

Use Cases - Student data organization - Mini-project for data
structures - CRUD-based system development practice - Learning dynamic
memory and linked lists

Future Enhancements - Adding search functionality - Exporting reports to
CSV/Excel - Password-protected access - GUI version with graphics
